```{r import libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)

library(skimr)
library(huxtable)
```

Reading salary data

```{r read data}

bank_salaries <-read.csv("bank_salaries.csv")

#Glimpse of the data:
skim(bank_salaries)

```

## Effect of gender on salary

```{r, Diff in means}

#Looking at mean salaries by gender with confidence intervals
gender_mean_salaries <- bank_salaries %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(
            mean = mean(salary),
            SD = sd(salary),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            SE = SD / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE,
            CI_low  = mean - margin_of_error,
            CI_high  = mean + margin_of_error
            )

gender_mean_salaries
```

Since the two intervals do not overlap, it is clear that there is a significant difference in female and male salaries. We now look at contributing factors.

### Visualizing Salary progression by Gender

```{r visualizing pay progression}

bank_salaries %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = years_bank, y = salary, color=gender, shape=factor(job_grade))) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = years_bank, y = salary, color=gender), method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Difference in Salary progression with experience based on Gender",
       x= "Experience in Bank (yrs)",
       y = "Salary")


```

> It can be seen that most women are in lower job grades, while there are more men at grades 5 and 6. It can also be noted that there are men with just 12/ 13 years of experience at grade 6 with salaries around 60000 while women in grade 6 with 36 years of experience might still receive a salary of around 20000.

### Regression Models to analyse impact of predictors on slalary

```{r model1}

mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=bank_salaries)

model1 <- lm(salary ~ gender , data=bank_salaries)
msummary(model1)

```

```{r predicting salary}

bank_salaries <- bank_salaries %>% 
  mutate( education = as.factor(education),
          job_grade = as.factor(job_grade))

model2 <- lm(salary ~ ., data=bank_salaries)
msummary(model2)
```

```{r predicting salary model 3}

model3 <- lm(salary ~ years_bank + gender + education + job_grade, 
             data=bank_salaries)
msummary(model3)
```

```{r predicting salary model 4}


model4 <- lm(salary ~ years_bank + gender + job_grade, 
             data=bank_salaries)
msummary(model4)
```

> #### Accounting for interactive variables:

```{r interactive variables}

model5 <- lm(salary ~ years_bank*gender, data=bank_salaries)
mosaic::msummary(model5)

model6 <- lm(salary ~ years_bank*gender + job_grade, data=bank_salaries)
mosaic::msummary(model6)

```

>While men start with about 6000 lower than women at grade 1, it is possible that they progress faster to higher grades. Men also receive 1035 more than women for every year they are at the bank.

```{r model comparison}

huxreg(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6,
       statistics = c('#observations' = 'nobs', 'R squared' = 'r.squared',
                      'Adj. R Squared' = 'adj.r.squared', 'Residual SE' = 'sigma'),
                      bold_signif = 0.05, stars = NULL ) %>% 
                      set_caption('Comparison of models')

```

### Distribution of gender at each job grade level

```{r gender at job grades}

bank_salaries %>% 
  group_by(gender, job_grade) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(percent_female = round(100 * Female / (Female+Male), 2),
         percent_male = round(100 * Male / (Female+Male), 2)) 

bank_salaries %>% 
  group_by(gender, job_grade) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = job_grade, y=n, fill=gender))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")


```

>Most women are concentrated at lower job grades while the percentage of men clearly exceeds women at higher levels. Possible reasons include women being overlooked for leadership roles and bias against women of certain age groups especially mid-career.
