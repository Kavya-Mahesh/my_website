<p>Hey, I’m Kavya Mahesh from India.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Chennai, a city in south India, and would pick filter coffee over a cappuccino any day! :)</p>
<p>I discovered my passion for the data space through internships at analytics start-ups, during my under graduation in Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Trichy. Upon graduation in 2020, I joined <strong>Fidelity Investments</strong> as a <em>data engineer</em> in their Business Metrics Data Lake squad. My role involved building dynamic ETL pipelines for data migration and curation of a cloud-based centralised data repository for Competitive Insights and analytics. I joined the <em>Masters in Analytics and Management</em> program at <strong>London Business School</strong> to help bridge the gap between data and business and wish to pursue a career at the intersection of the two.</p>
<p>On the personal front, I love <em>travelling</em> and <em>photography</em>. I’m generally an outdoor person and usually up for a trek or hike. I absolutely <em>love animals</em> and I’m a huge dog-person. I enjoy reading and wish I could say that the wizarding world and Cornish coast had nothing to do with my choice of joining LBS :D</p>
